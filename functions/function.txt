Javascript functions allow developers to reuse code and break up complex tasks into smaller pieces. In this lesson you will learn how to create and use simple functions.

function logMessage() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
 
logMessage();


Here, we created a function named logMessage that simply logs the message Hello world!. Then, we called the function. Let's take a look at how this works.

To create a function, we write the keyword function, followed by the name of the function and a pair of parentheses. Then follows some JavaScript code enclosed in curly braces.


This is called a function declaration.
After we have declared a function, we can call it by using its name and a pair of parentheses:
logMessage()


When you call a function, the code inside the function's body is executed (the part inside the curly braces).



---->There's another way to create functions which is called function expression. Here, we create a function and assign it to the variable logMessage. Notice that we omit the name of the function after the function keyword.
const logMessage = function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}


----->One more thing that you should know about functions is that they return values. You can return a value by using the return keyword.
function func() {
  return 5;
}
 
const result = func();
 
console.log(result);
 
****If you do not specify a return value, the function will return the value undefined**  



--->Note that the execution of a function stops immediately when it reaches a return statement. All code after the return statement is ignored.
function func() {
  return 5;
  console.log("I will not be logged.");
}
 
const result = func();
 
console.log(result);
