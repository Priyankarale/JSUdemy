Imagine we have the following variable:
let temperature = 75;
Javascript
The value of this variable will most likely change over time.
Now imagine that you want to inform the user of your application if it is warm outside – let's say if the temperature is above 70.
That's where we use our first if-statement. Run the code to see what happens.
let temperature = 75;
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature}`);
 
if (temperature > 70) {
   console.log("It's warm outside");
}



let temperature = 60;
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature}`);
 
if (temperature > 70) {
   console.log("It's warm outside");
}
Since the temperature is not above 70, the log statement is not executed.

But, how does it work?

The if-statement executes a block of code if a certain condition is true. It consists of the if keyword followed by a condition in parentheses, and a block of code in curly braces.
if (Condition) {
 Block of code
}


if...else statement - run else
This exercise is very similar to the previous one. But, this time we also have an else statement. An else statement is another piece of code – wrapped by curly braces – that only runs if the condition is not satisfied.
Adjust the condition such that the code inside the else statement will be executed and the console.log() statement logs true.
const isOnSale=false;
if(isOnSale){
  console.location("sale is live")
}
else
console.log("sale is off today')
