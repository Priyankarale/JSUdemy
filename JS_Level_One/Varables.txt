Variables --->are containers that store information for later use.
   ->lets create a variable
   -> let first_Name;
   ->We use the let keyword to declare a variable with the name test. Declaring a variable is JavaScript slang for creating a variable.
  ->But, what happens if we use console.log() to log our new variable?
      ->console.log(first_Name);
          ->It will Print undefined
  ->This is because we have not initialized our variable. Initializing a variable is the process of assigning a value to it.
Declaration----> of a variable in a computer programming language is a statement used to specify the variable name and its data type. Declaration tells the compiler about the existence of an entity in the program and its location. When you declare a variable, you should also initialize it.
Initialization----> is the process of assigning a value to the Variable. Every programming language has its own method of initializing the variable. If the value is not assigned to the Variable, then the process is only called a Declaration.
------>We can assign a value to a variable with the assignment operator =.
        let first_Name;
        first_Name=Priyanka;
        console.log(first_Name);
You can also assign a value to a variable directly when you create it
/*Reassign a value to a variable* */
/*let num =1;
let num=2;
console.log(num);*/  //here we will get an error i.e Identifier 'num' has already been declared 

//we will fix it here //
let num=1;
num =2;
console.log(num)   ///if we are using let keyword to declare our varible we can resign the value but we cant redecalre it

*********Create variables with const*****


We can also create variables a using const keyword;
const num=5;


The difference between the two is that you can not assign a new value to a variable that was created with const.
const num=5;
num=2;
we will get typeError


You also cannot declare a const-variable without assigning a value to it directly. See what happens if you try anyway:
const test;
SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration


  Question
  why should you use const instead of let
  --->It is considered good practice to use const for variables whoose value will never change.
        For example, if you want to store the number pi you would use const to store it because pi never changes.
        const pi = 3.14159;
  --->Doing so can prevent your code from behaving unexpectedly.


  Accessing a variable (1)

   const num=5;
   console.log(Num)
   we will get ReferenceError: Num is not defined

   Accessing a variable (2)
   console.log(num);
   const num = 5;

   ReferenceError: Cannot access 'num' before initialization
