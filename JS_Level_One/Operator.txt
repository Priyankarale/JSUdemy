-->We already know how to create variables and how to assign them numbers.
-->Now, we will learn how to compare these variables and their values with each other. We can do so by using comparison operators.
The first operator we explore is the Equal to (==) operator. It checks if two values are equal. 
For example:2==2

const priceOne=5;
const priceTwo=10;
console.log(priceOne==priceTwo)
Here, we used the Equal to (==) operator to check if the values of priceOne and priceTwo are equal.
Comparison operators always return a boolean value. In this case we got false because priceOne and priceTwo are not equal.


The second operator we explore is the Not Equal to (!=) operator. It checks if two values are not equal. For example:
2 !=2
const priceOne = 5;
const priceTwo = 10;
console.log(priceOne != priceTwo);
Now, we got true because priceOne and priceTwo are indeed not equal


*****Introduction to JavaScript Comparison Operators*****


The Greater than (>) operator checks if the left value is greater than the right value. For example:
2 > 1 // checks if 2 is greater than 1


The Less than (<) operator checks if the left value is less than the right value. For example:
2 < 1 // checks if 2 is less than 1


Similar to the operators above, there are also the Less than or equal (<=) and Greater than or equal (>=) operators. For example:
2 <= 1 // checks if 2 is less than or equal 1
2 >= 1 // checks if 2 is greater than or equal 1
