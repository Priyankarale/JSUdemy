In the previous sections you learnt how to create variables and assign numbers to them â€” like this one that indicates the price of an arbitrary product:
const price = 10;
But, sometimes you might want to store information that cannot be represented by a number.
For example, the product for which we already have a price could sometimes be on sale and sometimes not.
To store this kind of information we can use JavaScript Booleans, like so:
const isOnSale = true;
The value true indicates that the product is on sale.
Booleans can have only two values: true and false
If the product is not on sale, we assign false:
const isOnSale = false;

All of the following values are falsy:
false
null
undefined
0
-0
NaN
An empty string ('')
